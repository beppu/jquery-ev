h1. jQuery.ev

The purpose of this library is to provide an easy way to long-poll
on a URL for events and dispatch as they come in.

h2. Starting and Stopping the Event Loop

h3. $.ev.loop(url, channels)

h3. $.ev.stop()

h2. Adding Event Handlers

I took a very low-tech approach to event handlers.  Basically,
$.ev.handlers is treated as a hash that's keyed by event.type and
contains functions that will run when events of that type come in.

  $.ev.handlers['hello'] = function(ev){ console.log(ev.toSource()) };
